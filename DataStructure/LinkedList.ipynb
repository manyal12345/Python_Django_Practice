    "What is a Linked List?\n",
    "Linked Lists are a data structure that store data in the form of a chain. The structure of a linked list is such that each piece of data has a connection to the next one (and sometimes the previous data as well). Each element in a linked list is called a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as an actual chain, where each ring or node is connected.\n",
    "Something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "A-chain\n",
    "Like every other data structure, linked lists have their pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Linked Lists:\n",
    "Because of the chain-like system of linked lists, you can add and remove elements quickly. This also doesn't require reorganizing the data structure unlike arrays or lists. Linear data structures are often easier to implement using linked lists.\n",
    "Linked lists also don't require a fixed size or initial size due to their chainlike structure.\n",
    "Disadvantages of a Linked Lists:\n",
    "More memory is required when compared to an array. This is because you need a pointer (which takes up its own memory) to point you to the next element.\n",
    "Search operations on a linked list are very slow. Unlike an array, you don't have the option of random access.\n",
    "When Should You Use a Linked List?\n",
    "You should use a linked list over an array when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't know how many items will be in the list (that is one of the advantages - ease of adding items).\n",
    "You don't need random access to any elements (unlike an array, you cannot access an element at a particular index in a linked list).\n",
    "You want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list.\n",
    "You need constant time insertion/deletion from the list (unlike an array, you don't have to shift every other item in the list first)."

    "A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence. Each element in a linked list is called a \"node,\" and it consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: The actual value or payload that the node holds.\n",
    "Pointer (or Link): A reference or link to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically has a pointer that is set to None or null to indicate the end of the list.\n",
    "The first node of the linked list is called the \"head,\" and it serves as the starting point for accessing the elements in the list. If the list is empty, the head is set to None or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of some key concepts related to linked lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the sequence. It forms a unidirectional chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "rust\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> ... -> None\n",
    "Doubly Linked List: Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous nodes. It forms a bidirectional chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "rust\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "None <- Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 <-> ... -> None\n",
    "Circular Linked List: The last node in the list points back to the head, forming a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "rust\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> ... -> Head\n",
    "Linked lists have some advantages and disadvantages compared to other data structures like arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size during program execution.\n",
    "Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list can be more efficient than arrays, especially in the middle of the list.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Access: Accessing elements in a linked list by index requires traversing the list from the beginning, which can be less efficient than array indexing.\n",
    "Memory Overhead: Each node in a linked list requires additional memory for the pointer, which can result in higher memory usage compared to arrays.\n",
    "Linked lists are commonly used in scenarios where dynamic size and efficient insertions/deletions are crucial, but random access is not a primary concern. They serve as the foundation for more complex data structures like stacks, queues, and symbol tables."
